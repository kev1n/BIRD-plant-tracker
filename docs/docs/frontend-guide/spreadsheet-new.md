Other editable fields include "Date Planted", "Has Bloomed", and "notes. depending on the options you choose (explained below), these fields will be treated differently.

### Saving a new observation
Pressing the "New Observation" button will cause 4 buttons to take its place. The first button is "Cancel", which will delete the template observation created when you clicked "New Observation". "New Snapshot" will generate a new, blank snapshot with just the new observation in it. This is the only case in which the "Notes" field will NOT be overwritten. "Duplicate Snapshot" will copy the snapshot informationg \(including all associated observation\) from the latest snapshot assossiated with the specified "Patch ID" and add the new observation to the copy. "Add to current snapshot" will simply add the new observation to the latest snapshot for the specified patch. In the latter two cases, the "Notes" field is overwritten to that of the latest snapshot used, since "Notes" is associated with a snapshot.
