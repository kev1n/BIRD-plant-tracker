# Map View & Data Collection

This section details how to use the interactive map to navigate the sanctuary, inspect patches, and manage observational data through snapshots.

## Key Map Functionalities

- **[Navigating the Map](./map-navigation.md)**: Understand how to interact with the map, select patches, and view patch details.
- **[Creating & Managing Observations](./create-edit-delete-observations.md)**: Learn how to add new plant sightings to snapshots, edit existing ones, or remove them.
- **[Adding New Plant Species](./create-new-plant.md)**: Instructions for adding a new plant to the database if it's not found during observation creation.

## Understanding Snapshots

Remember, a **snapshot** represents the complete state of a patch at a specific time. All observations are part of a snapshot.

- **Adding to New Snapshots**: When you create a new snapshot for a patch.
- **Adding to Existing Snapshots**: When you edit an existing snapshot to update its observations.

Refer to the [Important Preface](../../important-preface) for a deeper understanding of patches, observations, and snapshots.
