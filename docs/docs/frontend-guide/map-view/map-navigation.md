## Map Overview

The map view consists of several key components:
- **Interactive Grid**: A grid overlay showing labeled patches (A1, A2, B1, etc.) that you can click to select
- **Sidebar Tools**: Contains location services and filtering options (desktop) or accessible via menu button (mobile)
- **Patch Information**: Details about selected patches appear in the right panel (desktop) or bottom panel (mobile)

## Where Am I Feature

The "Where Am I" section in the sidebar helps you locate yourself on the map and navigate to your current position.

### Location Permissions
When you first visit the map, you may see a location permission dialog after a few seconds. This allows the app to:
- Show your current location on the map
- Highlight the patch you're currently standing in (if within the sanctuary boundaries)
- Provide a "Pan to My Location" button for easy navigation

### Using Location Services
- **Grant Permission**: Click "Allow" when prompted to enable location services
- **View Your Location**: If you're within a valid patch, it will be highlighted in green on the map
- **Pan to Location**: Use the "Pan to My Location" button in the sidebar to center the map on your current position
- **Outside Sanctuary**: If you're outside the mapped area, a red marker will show your approximate location

## Plant Filtering

The filtering system allows you to highlight patches containing specific plants using color-coded stripes.

### How to Use Filters
1. **Access Filters**: Located in the sidebar under "Plant Filters" (desktop) or in the mobile menu
2. **Select Plants**: Choose which plants you want to highlight by checking the boxes next to plant names
3. **Color Coding**: Each selected plant gets assigned a unique color
4. **Patch Highlighting**: Patches containing the selected plants will display colored stripes corresponding to the plants found there
5. **Multiple Plants**: If a patch contains multiple filtered plants, it will show multiple colored stripes

### Filter Benefits
- Quickly locate specific plant species across the sanctuary
- Visualize plant distribution patterns
- Plan observation routes based on target species
