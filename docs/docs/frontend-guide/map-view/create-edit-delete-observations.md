# Creating & Managing Snapshots and Observations

## Creating New Snapshots

To add a new snapshot:
- Click on the grid patch you are interested in on the map view
- Click on the "View Latest Snapshot" green button on the right bar (desktop) or bottom panel (mobile)
- Click on "New Snapshot" at the bottom left

![New snapshot interface](../map-view-images/map-view-images.png)

When creating a new snapshot, you can:
- Input new observations of plants as needed
- Add any notes about the patch condition or observations
- Set the snapshot date
- Click "Submit" when you are done
- Use the "Duplicate Latest Data" button to copy data from the latest snapshot into the current snapshot, then edit the fields as needed

**Important**: Double check the patch number at the top left before submitting any data into the snapshot.

## Viewing Historical Snapshots

To look at historic snapshots:
1. Go back to the main view of the patch:
   ![Patch main view](../map-view-images/patch-main-view.png)

2. On the bottom right corner, there should be a "History" button. Click this button to see a historical list of snapshots, sorted by date created.
   ![Patch history list](../map-view-images/patch-history.png)

3. For each historical snapshot, you can use:
   - **"View" button**: Pull up the past snapshot for review
   - **"Edit" button**: Make changes to that past snapshot  
   - **"Delete" button**: Remove the snapshot along with all the observations attached to it from the database

The Edit and View pages will be very similar to the "New Snapshot" and "Latest snapshot" pages.

## Adding a new observation while making/editing a snapshot

To add a new observation (a plant sighting for a snapshot), click the "New Observation" button under the Plants section of any type of Snapshot modification screen. This could be for making new snapshots or editing snapshots. 

![new snapshot form](../map-view-images/map-view-images.png)

Clicking the New Observation button will lead you to a "New Observation" form that you will need to fill. 

![observation form](../observation-images/new-observation.png)

In this from, you will see these fields:
1. Plant Common Name (required)
    - This is where you choose which plant you want this observation to be for. Do so by clicking the "Select plant" button and then typing at least one character to see a listing of possible plats
![plant search on observation form](../observation-images/plant-search.png)
    - The list will show the plant common name, the scientific name in parentheses, whether the plant is native or non-native, and the plant type. 
    - If you cannot find the plant you are looking for, please see the [creating a new plant](./create-new-plant) page about adding a new plant when you can't find the plant you are looking for. 
2. Has Bloomed (optional)
    - Use the "Yes," "No," and "Not Applicable" radio buttons to indicate whether the plant has bloomed. This section is automatically set to "Not Applicable."
3. Date Planted (optional)
    - Click the Select a Date button and use the popup calendar to select a date planted for the plant observation. 

## Editing/Deleting Observations
