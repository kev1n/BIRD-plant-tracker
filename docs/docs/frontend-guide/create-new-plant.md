Fill in this form and click submit to create a new plant in the database. The fields you will need to fill are as follows:
1. Common Name (required)
    - This is the common name for the plant (like, blue orchid, for example). 
2. Scientific Name (optional)
    - If you know the common name for the plant, please add it here as well. 
3. Subcategory
    - Here, you can choose the subcategory that the plant is in as well. You can choose between Forbs, Shrubs, Tree, Grass, and Other. 

After you press submit, you should be back a the observation form. The plant you want will show when you begin searching again.
