# Plant Tracker

## Overview
Clark Street Beach Bird Sanctuary is a two acre bird sanctuary located on Clark Street Beach. It consists of many varieties of trees, flowers, shrubs, grasses, insects, and pollinators. Altogether, the sanctuary serves as a migratory hub for birds.

Week by week maintenance of the sanctuary consists of clearing out invasive species of plants, monitoring the success of existing plants and caring for them (e.g. pruning, watering), planting new native species, and debating the best future types of plants to incorporate into the ecosystem.

Few long-time members and stewards of the sanctuary have extensive plant knowledge. They know what plants are where and how they’ve developed over time. The recordkeeping is largely within their heads.

Without a centralized way of recordkeeping, these data can’t be easily accessed or utilized. For example, volunteers of the sanctuary, who often have little plant knowledge but seek out information, must ask the stewards. Furthermore, when members debate between which types of plants to grow, they turn to personal hypotheses. With proper data, they can make more data-driven decisions:
* Why are certain plants successful in certain areas and not in others?
* How has a certain plant performed over time?
* What factors most contribute to their success?

These observations, trends, and experiments can be tracked easily with a grid-based map system that allows intuitive access and reporting of this data.

## Scenarios
**Scenario 1: Lauren Mapping Out the Area**
Lauren is a volunteer from Northwestern. There are too many volunteers so the volunteer coordinator assigns her to map out the area. She opens the app to a view of the sanctuary on the “Map View” page, and checks the “Where Am I?” widget, which uses her phone’s GPS to identify which patch she is currently standing on. Crouching down, she spots a bearberry that wasn’t previously recorded on this square. She types in the observation on the website and it’s saved as a snapshot in time. She continues to walk around, recording her observations like the number of plants (i.e., cactus), the measurements of the trees (i.e., oak trees), or noticing that a flower has bloomed. 

**Scenario 2: Robert Tracking Trends**
Robert is a co-steward deciding which new plants could be used to fill in empty space left by a diseased tree that was cut down. However, he forgets which plants have thrived before in the area. To gain more clarity, he looks at the Plant Tracker, particularly at the history of past plants on the patch. Through this, he is able to filter based on the success and bloom times of past plants. At the next steering committee meeting, he argues for Black Oak, seeing that it thrives well in patches with sand and provides acorns for birds.

**Scenario 3: Sean Learning About Plants.**
Sean is a new volunteer that wants to gain more experience with the trees on his own time. He comes to the Sanctuary during a non-work day and goes around with the website on his phone. As he walks around with his location on, the website alerts him to which patch he’s in and what species of plants he can observe near him. He identifies the Box Elders in front of him with their description on the website. He also sees its scientific name, Acer negundo, and a blurb of information about it that was recorded by other volunteers. As he walks around, he gets to know much more about the varieties of plants in the Sanctuary.

## Goals
This project will support the following features:
We will deliver a product that achieves the features we listed before June 10th, 2025.

We will write documentation/metadata for how to reproduce and manage the technology that we create. This will be a detailed report that ensures it can be maintained for years to come. 

## Non Goals
* This project will not support the following features:
  * We are not in charge of populating the grid of data
  * This will be performed by sanctuary volunteers
* Keeping track of each individual plant
  * Sanctuary will be divided into 15 ft x 15 ft patches with plant and soil information given per-patches
* We do not need to keep track of birds
  * Volunteer bird monitors already use other software to track bird appearances
* Birds are not stationary
* It is not necessary to attach pictures of plants to any cells/data on the website
* We are not creating a paper map
